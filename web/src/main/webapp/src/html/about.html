                <p>Mentored and on-boarded new developers, tasked junior developers, and managed large amounts of tasking through delegation and distribution of workload amongst UI team.
                    Benchmarked specifications for implementation, authored and contributed to technical software documentation to bolster productivity among developers.
                    Implemented development processes, sprint battle rhythm, and executed meetings to optimize NCSA software development team productivity using agile methodologies.
                    Optimized rhythm of 3-week sprint for cross-functional team of 10 engineers resulting in increased team velocity/output by 30-40%, weekly builds (vice quarterly), and doubling active users.
                    Streamlined implementation, enhancement, and maintenance of the entire software lifecycle through the use of JIRA and Atlassian tool suite.
                    All tasking and output from concept development (Product Owner), data acquisition (SME), UI/UX design (HSI), software development (Dev team), operations (Ops team) to management was tracked and accounted for in JIRA and/or Confluence
